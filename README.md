This project features two Flutter apps that handle and launch a custom deep link. These programs, created with the [uni_links](https://pub.dev/packages/uni_links) and [url_launcher](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher) packages, efficiently handle deep links and launch them within their own apps.

This project also acts as a pleasant addition to my portfolio, displaying my abilities in deep link implementation using Flutter. It aims to be a useful resource for other students interested in understanding and implementing deep linkages in Flutter apps. Learners can acquire insights into efficiently integrating deep linking capabilities into their own applications and enhance their expertise in this area by investigating the code and functions.
